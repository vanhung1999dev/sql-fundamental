✅ SQL Logical Query Processing Order (FROM → SELECT)

Here is the correct order that every SQL query follows logically:

### 1. FROM
- Pick the main table(s).
- Apply aliases.
- Do all joins.

### 2. ON
- Apply join conditions for each JOIN.

### 3. JOIN
- Combine tables (INNER, LEFT, RIGHT, FULL).

### 4. WHERE
- Filter rows before grouping.
- Cannot use aggregate functions in WHERE.

### 5. GROUP BY
- Group rows into buckets.
- Prepare for aggregates.

### 6. HAVING

- Filter groups after aggregation.
- Can use SUM(), COUNT(), AVG(), etc.

### 7. SELECT

- Select columns.
- Compute expressions.
- Apply aliases (aliases become available only here).

### 8. DISTINCT

- Remove duplicates from the SELECT result.

### 9. ORDER BY
- Sort rows.
- Can use SELECT aliases.

### 10. LIMIT / OFFSET

- Return only a specific number of rows.
